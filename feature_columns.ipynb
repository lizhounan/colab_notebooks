Instead of representing the data as a one-hot vector of many dimensions, an [embedding column](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/feature_column/embedding_column) represents that data as a lower-dimensional, dense vector in which each cell can contain any number, not just 0 or 1. The size of the embedding (8, in the example below) is a parameter that must be tuned.\n","\n","Key point: using an embedding column is best when a categorical column has many possible values.

When working with a small dataset like this one, we recommend using a decision tree or random forest as a strong baseline. The goal of this tutorial is not to train an accurate model, but to demonstrate the mechanics of working with structured data, so you have code to use as a starting point when working with your own datasets in the future."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"SotnhVWuHQCw"},"source":["## Next steps\n","The best way to learn more about classifying structured data is to try it yourself.

To improve accuracy, think carefully about which features to include in your model, and how they should be represented."]}]}
